    - **total_power** : Total power density spectra

    - **vlf** : variance ( = power ) in HRV in the Very low Frequency (.003 to .04 Hz by default).
    Reflect an intrinsic rhythm produced by the heart which is modulated primarily by sympathetic
    activity.

    - **lf** : variance ( = power ) in HRV in the low Frequency (.04 to .15 Hz). Reflects a
    mixture of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, but in long-term recordings like ours,
    it reflects sympathetic activity and can be reduced by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propanolol

    - **hf**: variance ( = power ) in HRV in the High Frequency (.15 to .40 Hz by default).
    Reflects fast changes in beat-to-beat variability due to parasympathetic (vagal) activity.
    Sometimes called the respiratory band because it corresponds to HRV changes related to the
    respiratory cycle and can be increased by slow, deep breathing (about 6 or 7 breaths per
    minute) and decreased by anticholinergic drugs or vagal blockade.

    - **lf_hf_ratio** : lf/hf ratio is sometimes used by some investigators as a quantitative mirror
    of the sympatho/vagal balance.

    - **lfnu** : normalized lf power

    - **hfnu** : normalized hf power
